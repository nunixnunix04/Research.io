# Research.io

Research.io is a research assistant aimed to minimize time spent on tedious tasks during the paper-writing process.
Through the [Research.io website](https://nunixnunix04.github.io/Research.io/), users can fill in a template for MLA and APA formatted papers.
Once the template has been set, users can type into the textbox.
On the sidebar, relevants statistics concerning the paper are given in real time as the user writes their paper.

## Wikipedia Source Finder

The Wikipedia Source Finder is a python script that returns a relevant source related to a user-made claim.
In the python file, a user can replace the wiki_search variable with a claim.
Once the script is run, the most relevant wikipedia page will be found relating to that claim.
Then, the page is scanned for the sentence most closely matching the claim.
Finally, the next immediate source in the wikipedia page after the identified sentence from before is referenced and the APA source is outputted.
